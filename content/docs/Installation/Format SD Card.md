# Formating Your Micro SD Card
---
1. First, you want to download the [SD Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/). Get your SD card, insert into your computer, and “quick format” the card using the SD Card Formatter. **Please make sure that nothing else is on the selected SD card, because everything will be deleted**.

2. You can move onto the next step once you’ve received a pop-up saying that the SD card chosen has been formatted (**Make sure the file system is FAT32**).
