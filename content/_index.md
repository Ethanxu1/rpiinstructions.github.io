# Why Raspberry PI Router?
This is an instruction guide to help people who want to get into Raspberry PIs but are looking for a simple place to start and explore its potential. This set of instructions is designed to be very **beginner friendly**. Minimal knowledge about linux and networking is nessesary to follow along. 

Making your own raspberry pi offers many advantages including:
## Customization and Control. 
- Full control over what kind of router that you would like to have. 
- Firewall rules, VPNs, DNS settings, and even bandwidth management (as long as it goes by certain rules set up by the state, country, or government.
## Cost-Effective Solution.
- Buying a router that is designated for small network homes would be great to stay away from big Wi-Fi companies and having to spend over $100 a month to have a good internet connection.
## Enhanced Privacy and Security.
- Being able to bypass any limitations that have been imposed by an internet provider such as block ports or just router restrictions.
- Great chance to get rid of pesky ads and even malicious domains by setting up ad blockers and DNS filtering.
## Travel Usage.
- Carry your own made router with you to areas that don’t have great service and be able to avoid risky public networks that can’t be trusted.
## Educational Value.
- Great for understanding network concepts like **DHCP**, **NAT**, and **port forwarding**.
Experiment; try different OSes, routing protocols, or mesh networking setups without risking your main home network.
