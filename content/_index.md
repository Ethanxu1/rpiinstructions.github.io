# Why Raspberry Pi Router?

This guide is for people who want a simple, hands-on way to get into Raspberry Pi projects and home networking. You don’t need to be a Linux or networking expert to follow along, we assume **minimal** background and walk through each step carefully.

Turning a Raspberry Pi into a router offers many advantages, especially if you like to customize your setup and understand how your network actually works.

## Customization and Control

- **Build** the kind of router *you* want instead of whatever your ISP or big router brands decide for you.
- Fine-tune firewall rules, VPNs, DNS settings, and bandwidth management instead of being stuck with a locked-down “advanced settings” page.

## Cost-Effective Solution

- If you already own a Raspberry Pi or buy one, turning it into a router can be a **low-cost way** to get features (VPN, ad-blocking, custom DNS, etc.) that usually require more expensive “prosumer” routers.
- Many internet providers charge a monthly fee to rent their modem/router combo. Using your own gear and putting the ISP device into bridge or passthrough mode (when supported) can help you avoid those ongoing rental fees.

## Enhanced Privacy and Security

- Avoid “black box” routers where you can’t see what’s running or which data is being collected.
- Bypass some limitations imposed by your internet provider, such as blocked ports or restrictive router settings.
- Add network-wide ad-blocking and DNS filtering to cut down on tracking, malicious domains, and annoying ads for every device on your network at once.

## Travel Usage

- Bring your own router to hotels, coffee shops, and dorms so all your devices connect to **your** trusted Wi-Fi instead of random public networks.
- Set up a single secure Wi-Fi network for your laptop, phone, and tablet, even if you have to log in through a clunky hotel or campus portal once.
- Use the same SSID and password everywhere you go so your devices just connect. No need to reconfigure them every time.

## Educational Value

- Learn core networking concepts like **DHCP**, **NAT**, and **routing**, by actually configuring them.
- See what’s happening on your network with real tools (logs, statistics, and status pages) instead of a simple “Wi-Fi on/off” switch.
- Treat the Raspberry Pi router as a safe “lab”: break things, fix them, and build up real troubleshooting skills you can reuse in future projects or jobs.
